# OverlandFlow
MATLAB codes for overland flow scenarios

<em>General Notes:</em>
<p>1) The codes in this repository work for varying rainfall scenarios, such as constant rainflow over entire landscape, short isolated storms, and moving storms.
<p>2) Do not uncomment the different rainfall scenarios within a code to test other scenarios. Open the separate codes (named for their rainfall scenario) to see the results of different scenarios. While the codes would function fine, the plot formatting would become less visually appealing. </p>
