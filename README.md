# OverlandFlow
MATLAB codes for overland flow scenarios

<em>General Notes:</em>
<p>1) The codes in this repository work for varying rainfall scenarios, such as constant rainflow over entire landscape, short isolated storms, and moving storms.
<p>2) File names should reflect the rainfall scenario being simulated </p>
<p>3) The UnitTestinOverlandFlow code tests to see that the Q goes steady at three different locations along x at the appropriate time scale. The time to test each location is determined by the steady state drainage response timescale. If the Q is not in steady state when it is supposed to be at each location, the code will stop running and send the message 'code sucks.'</p>
